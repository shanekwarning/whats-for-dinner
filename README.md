## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. This app will help users chose a meal to prep for dinner and allow them to add their own options.

### How to Use the Site

User can click any of the radio buttons. Once a radio button is clicked the user will then be able to click the 'Let's Cook' button to hide the cook pot image and it will be replaced by an item assigned to the selected radio button. At the top of th apge users can click the 'Add a Recipe' button to show the form at the button of the page that will allow them input their own dish and assign it to the radio button of their choice. 

## Potential Future Features

  * Allowing the Clear button to clear the current meal text and replace it with a default.
  * Having a sign in page when a user firsts accesses the account.
  * Having the option to have a Side, Main and Dessert all display at the same time with an additional radio button for Entire Meal.
